# wordqlock

### This project is a very very simple wrapper for a wordclock.
### It is intended as a prototyping platform for any hardware development 
### in order to provide a framework which simulates the visualization.

The idea is, that one is able to incrementally go forward and stub/mock the Hardware interfaces
and that therefore development may be speeded up for those who are interested in
creating their own wordqlock.

By the way, there is a compiled version for mac. 

/dist/visu/ --> ./visu 

Cheers Mat.
